        <h2>Project Description and Overview</h2>
        <p>The Wayback Public Library System is a comprehensive library management application designed to handle book inventory, 
            patron management, and borrowing activities. Developed as part of a collaborative project, it utilizes modern web technologies 
            and adheres to agile practices for efficient delivery.</p>
        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> I served as the team leader and played a pivotal role in both front-end and back-end development. 
            I guided the team through the project using Scrum methodology, facilitated the use of GitHub and IDEs, and contributed significantly 
            to the development and implementation of key features. My responsibilities also included ensuring effective communication within the 
            team and overseeing the integration of various components to achieve the project goals.</p>

            email addresses and phone numbers follow a valid format to maintain data integrity.</p>
        <p><strong>Borrowing and Returning Books:</strong> Patrons can borrow and return books, with the system enforcing rules such as no 
            overdue books and checking for existing borrowed books.</p>
        <p><strong>Search and Filter Options:</strong> Users can search and filter books based on various criteria, including title, author, 
            and genre. The search functionality is optimized for quick and accurate results.</p>
        <p><strong>Administrative Controls:</strong> Admins can manage users, oversee borrowing activities, and generate reports on system usage. 
            Permissions and roles are defined to ensure appropriate access levels.</p>
