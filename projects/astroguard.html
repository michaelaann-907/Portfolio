        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This project involved planning and developing an educational game to teach Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 
            concepts for Department of Defense (DOD) contractors. The game aimed to help small businesses and their employees understand 
            and implement CMMC to enhance their cybersecurity defenses.</p>

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aimed to address the critical need for enhanced cybersecurity measures, particularly for entities engaged with the 
            Department of Defense (DOD), by developing an educational game to simplify the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). 
            The game was designed to cater to everyday employees of DOD contractors, helping them understand and implement CMMC principles to 
            bolster cybersecurity defenses. Throughout the project, key factors in game planning and development were explored, including target 
            audience considerations, engaging design principles, and alignment with educational objectives. Despite facing challenges due to a 
            lack of prior game development experience, the process was rewarding, providing valuable insights into the complexities of game 
            development while highlighting the importance of cybersecurity education in today's digital landscape. Ultimately, the project 
            aimed to empower users with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the complexities of CMMC and enhance cybersecurity practices 
            within their organizations.</p>

    <section id="purpose">
        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>This project served as my capstone for my graduate studies and provided me with valuable insights into game development.</p>
        <p>Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the various factors involved in planning and proposing an educational game. 
            I learned to consider the target audience's needs, the importance of engaging and intuitive design, and the necessity of aligning 
            game objectives with educational goals. Additionally, I acquired practical experience in the full game development process, including 
            concept creation, design, programming, testing, and implementation. This comprehensive understanding has equipped me with the skills 
            to develop effective educational tools that can simplify complex subjects like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 
            for everyday employees.</p>
        <p>This project was both rewarding and challenging. It was gratifying to see the educational game take shape and know it could make a 
            difference in understanding cybersecurity concepts. However, without any prior experience or knowledge in game development, I faced a 
            steep learning curve. Despite the challenges, gaining insights into game design, programming, and implementation was incredibly 
            fulfilling.</p>
