        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Michaela Pierce! I recently graduated with my Master’s degree in Computer Science & Information Systems from 
            the University of North Carolina Wilmington. I am passionate about Computer Science and enjoy learning about all areas 
            in the technology industry. I love exploring different fields and never specialized in one particular area because I 
            enjoyed learning about so many. This broad interest has made me well-rounded in multiple subjects.</p>
        <p>I am a fast learner and very determined to succeed. An example of this is my capstone project for my master's degree, 
            where I developed a game to teach the CMMC to the average employee. When I discussed this with my advisor, he suggested 
            a 2D game in JavaScript. Since I was already familiar with JavaScript, I saw this as an opportunity to learn something 
            new. I exceeded expectations by developing a 3D game using Unreal Engine, a platform I chose because of its potential 
            for future expansion. Despite starting with no game development knowledge, I completed this project in under two months, 
            teaching myself Unreal Engine from scratch and overcoming roadblocks independently, as none of my advisors had experience 
            with it.</p>
        <p>I see projects as opportunities to learn new skills rather than just applying what I already know. I have taught myself 
            many things, including using virtual machines, penetration testing, various programming languages, etc. My mom always 
            emphasized that education is something no one can take away from you, and this belief has deeply influenced me. 
            As a result, I take great joy in sharing my knowledge, teaching others, and constantly learning. I have a thirst for 
            knowledge and believe that knowledge is truly power. Professionally, I have worked as a General AI Data Annotator with 
            RWS Global for Meta/Facebook on the Llama Project, where I played a key role in enhancing language models through precise 
            data annotation. This experience, along with my hands-on work across different tech domains, fuels my enthusiasm for 
            solving complex problems and creating impactful solutions.</p>
    
        <p>Thank you so much for your time and for visiting my portfolio—I’m excited about the possibility of connecting and exploring 
            new opportunities!</p>
