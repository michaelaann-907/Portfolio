        <section id="fast-exponentiation">
            <h3>Fast Exponentiation</h3>
            <p>The provided program implements the fast exponentiation algorithm, allowing for efficient modular exponentiation calculations,
                which is a fundamental operation in many cryptographic algorithms.</p>
            <p>Fast exponentiation is a technique used in cryptography to efficiently compute large exponentiations modulo a given number.
                It reduces the number of computations required by utilizing the binary representation of the exponent, resulting in significant
                time savings.</p>

            <h3>KMS Vault</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the usage of a Key Management System (KMS) by utilizing the Vault server to securely encrypt and decrypt
                messages using the "aes256-gcm96" algorithm, highlighting the importance of proper key management in cryptographic operations.</p>
            <p>KMS (Key Management System) in cryptography refers to a software or hardware-based solution designed to securely generate, store,
                and manage cryptographic keys.</p>

            <h3>Vigenere Cipher</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the encryption and decryption of an HTML file using the Vigenere Cipher technique, showcasing the process
                of file encryption and decryption in cryptography.</p>
            <p>The Vigenere Cipher is a classic encryption technique that uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. It operates
                by shifting each character in the plaintext by a corresponding key character, wrapping around the alphabet when necessary.</p>

        <section id="euclid-algorithm">
            <h3>Euclid Algorithm</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the Euclid algorithm for finding the GCD of two integers, showcasing the step-by-step calculation and
                highlighting the utility of the algorithm in cryptography and other mathematical applications.</p>
            <p>The Euclid algorithm, also known as the Euclidean algorithm, is a mathematical algorithm used to find the greatest common divisor
                (GCD) of two integers. It repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and replaces the larger number with the
                remainder. This process continues until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.</p>

        <section id="prng-stream-cipher">
            <h3>PRNG & Stream Cipher</h3>
            <p>This program is a combination of a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) and a Stream Cipher for encryption and decryption of
                messages. It utilizes a random seed to introduce an element of randomness into the encryption process.</p>
            <p>Random seed pseudo-generator refers to the use of an initial value (seed) to initialize the PRNG, which then generates a sequence
                of pseudo-random numbers used for encryption. The XOR operation is used to combine the pseudo-random numbers with the plaintext
                to produce the ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption.</p>

        <section id="rsa">
            <h3>RSA</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the RSA algorithm, a widely used public-key cryptosystem, including key generation, encryption, and
                decryption processes.</p>
            <p>The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for
                decryption. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.</p>
