        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This project involved the installation and configuration of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for a growing 
            small fictional business, enabling the collection of network traffic and implementation of rules for enhanced network 
            security. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in network security and rule-based NIDS implementation.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Barker Labs, a clinical research lab that has developed a comprehensive vaccine for COVID-19, has gained prominence due 
            to its unique attributes. Unlike other vaccines that require multiple doses, fail to protect against related variants, 
            and may cause significant side effects or unforeseen complications, Barker Labs' one-time vaccine prevents COVID-19 and 
            all its relative variants. While currently undergoing human testing, the vaccine has already garnered attention amidst 
            competition.</p>
        <p>Barker Labs, founded two years ago, has experienced steady growth alongside its clinical research endeavors. However, 
            their Information Technology (IT) Department has relied on the same Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for the 
            past two years. Initially, threats were not a major concern due to the company's small size and the availability of other 
            competitors' findings and vaccines in the market. Nevertheless, the existing NIDS is now outdated and incapable of detecting 
            emerging threats or providing valuable insights to enhance other cybersecurity components.</p>
        <p>To address these challenges, a new NIDS system will be implemented and configured, empowering the IT Department to make informed 
            decisions regarding additional preventive measures that can bolster the network security of the company.</p>

        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
        <p>This project served as my capstone for my undergraduate studies and provided me with valuable insights into network security. 
            It allowed me to delve into the intricacies of implementing rules for the NIDS, enabling it to effectively collect and analyze 
            network traffic.</p>
        <p>During the project, I gained knowledge about various network security concepts, such as intrusion detection and prevention, as well 
            as the importance of creating specific rules tailored to the business's needs. These rules were instrumental in ensuring that the 
            NIDS efficiently captured relevant network traffic, providing a solid foundation for monitoring and identifying potential security 
            threats.</p>
        <p>Engaging in this capstone project not only broadened my understanding of network security principles but also equipped me with practical 
            skills in configuring and optimizing an NIDS to meet specific requirements. It was a rewarding experience that enhanced my academic 
            journey and prepared me for future endeavors in the field of network security.</p>

        <h3>Project Implementation Details</h3>
        <p>For this project, I utilized Snort as the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Snort is an open-source solution renowned for 
            its flexibility and effectiveness in detecting and preventing network intrusions. Its open-source nature significantly reduced costs, 
            making it an economical choice for the project.</p>
        <p>I chose Snort because of its robust intrusion detection capabilities and its ability to be customized with specific rules tailored to 
            the business's security needs. This made it an ideal tool for analyzing network traffic and detecting potential threats.</p>
        <p>In terms of infrastructure, I used Virtual Machines to simulate the fictional business's Linux-based systems. Specifically, I deployed 
            the Ubuntu distribution within these VMs. Additionally, I utilized my localhost, which runs Windows, to facilitate various aspects of 
            the configuration and testing process.</p>
        <p>Overall, Snort's features, combined with the use of Virtual Machines and my local environment, allowed for a comprehensive and effective
            implementation of the NIDS.</p>

        <h2>Project Report</h2>
        <p>I chose Snort as the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) due to its open-source nature, which helped reduce costs. Snort offers 
            comprehensive protection by functioning as both an intrusion detection and prevention system, identifying potential threats and taking 
            action to prevent them. To simulate the fictional business environment, I used Virtual Machines with the Ubuntu Linux distribution and 
            my local Windows host system.</p>
