        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I have developed multiple software applications that utilize advanced cryptographic algorithms to ensure secure data 
            encryption and decryption. These programs were successfully completed as part of my coursework in a cryptography-focused 
            curriculum.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>I have acquired familiarity with various cryptography algorithms through a combination of academic studies and self-learning. 
            My exploration of this field has included completing assignments that required implementing cryptographic techniques using Python.</p>
        <p>I have developed a solid understanding of fundamental concepts such as historical ciphers, encryption, randomness, cryptographic 
            security, block ciphers, hash functions, authenticated encryption, RSA encryption, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, and 
            TLS. By delving into these topics, I have gained insights into both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of 
            modern-day cryptography.</p>
        <p>Moreover, my independent study and hands-on implementation of cryptographic algorithms have provided me with a deeper understanding 
            of their inner workings and vulnerabilities. While I may not claim expertise in applying these algorithms to real-world problems, 
            my knowledge and experience allow me to confidently navigate the principles and techniques of cryptography.</p>
        <p>Overall, my exploration of cryptography, both through formal academic studies and independent learning, has equipped me with a strong 
            grasp of cryptographic algorithms and their underlying concepts. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge in this field and 
            exploring new applications of cryptography in the realm of IT.</p>

        <section id="fast-exponentiation">
            <h3>Fast Exponentiation</h3>
            <p>The provided program implements the fast exponentiation algorithm, allowing for efficient modular exponentiation calculations, 
                which is a fundamental operation in many cryptographic algorithms.</p>
            <p>Fast exponentiation is a technique used in cryptography to efficiently compute large exponentiations modulo a given number. 
                It reduces the number of computations required by utilizing the binary representation of the exponent, resulting in significant 
                time savings.</p>

            <h3>KMS Vault</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the usage of a Key Management System (KMS) by utilizing the Vault server to securely encrypt and decrypt 
                messages using the "aes256-gcm96" algorithm, highlighting the importance of proper key management in cryptographic operations.</p>
            <p>KMS (Key Management System) in cryptography refers to a software or hardware-based solution designed to securely generate, store, 
                and manage cryptographic keys.</p>

        <section id="vigenere-cipher">
            <h3>Vigenere Cipher</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the encryption and decryption of an HTML file using the Vigenere Cipher technique, showcasing the process 
                of file encryption and decryption in cryptography.</p>
            <p>The Vigenere Cipher is a classic encryption technique that uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. It operates 
                by shifting each character in the plaintext by a corresponding key character, wrapping around the alphabet when necessary.</p>

        <section id="euclid-algorithm">
            <h3>Euclid Algorithm</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the Euclid algorithm for finding the GCD of two integers, showcasing the step-by-step calculation and 
                highlighting the utility of the algorithm in cryptography and other mathematical applications.</p>
            <p>The Euclid algorithm, also known as the Euclidean algorithm, is a mathematical algorithm used to find the greatest common divisor 
                (GCD) of two integers. It repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and replaces the larger number with the 
                remainder. This process continues until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero remainder.</p>

        <section id="prng-stream-cipher">
            <h3>PRNG & Stream Cipher</h3>
            <p>This program is a combination of a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) and a Stream Cipher for encryption and decryption of 
                messages. It utilizes a random seed to introduce an element of randomness into the encryption process.</p>
            <p>Random seed pseudo-generator refers to the use of an initial value (seed) to initialize the PRNG, which then generates a sequence 
                of pseudo-random numbers used for encryption. The XOR operation is used to combine the pseudo-random numbers with the plaintext 
                to produce the ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption.</p>

        <section id="rsa">
            <h3>RSA</h3>
            <p>This program demonstrates the RSA algorithm, a widely used public-key cryptosystem, including key generation, encryption, and 
                decryption processes.</p>
            <p>The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for 
                decryption. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.</p>
